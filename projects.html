The following is a list of personal projects that I am either currently working on, or are
currently in use.

<ul class="item-summary projects-summary">
  {% assign sorted = site.data.projects | date_sort: 'startDate' %}
  {% for entry_hash in sorted reversed %}
  {% assign entry = entry_hash[1] %}
  <li>
    <h3 class="title">
      <a href="/projects/{{ entry._id }}.html">
        {{ entry.name }}
      </a>
    </h3>
    <div class="summary">
      {{ entry.description | markdownify }}
