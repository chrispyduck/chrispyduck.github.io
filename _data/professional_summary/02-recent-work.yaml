  Over the past four years, I have been focused on applying this process to
  create SMEIR, an information warfare training environment for the US
  special forces, that leverages a wide variety of commercial, open-source,
  and purpose-built software and hardware to replicate social media, news,
  commerce, utilities, and other major industries, enabling operators to
  “train as they fight.” SMEIR began as a proof of concept with a few LAMP
  stack websites replicating the functionality and appearance of Twitter,
  Facebook, and YouTube, running on a single box. When users wanted to test
  offensive cyber operations against one website without disrupting another,
  I split the applications across several VMs and began migrating to Docker
  containers to simplify deployments; when exercise planners needed a means
  of easily manipulating the cyber range, I created a central command and
  control tool capable of managing the websites. Over time, more products
  were added: Wikipedia, SnapChat, Gmail, IRC, and Tor, to name a few. As
  new feedback and new requests came in, I reviewed what they meant for the
  product and whether they fit into the vision or whether the vision needed
  to be refined. At each stage I also evaluated whether the architecture 
  and infrastructure supported the current vision, which led me to the 
  realization that SMEIR had outgrown Docker Swarm and led me to migrate to
  Kubernetes to take advantage of it’s more mature automation and scaling 
  capabilities. Throughout my four years of leadership, SMEIR grew from that
  single server running a LAMP stack to a highly scalable and rapidly
  replicable Kubernetes cluster consisting of over 100 distinct components,
  and I grew the team to more than 15 developers, testers, DevOps, and
  sysadmins.
