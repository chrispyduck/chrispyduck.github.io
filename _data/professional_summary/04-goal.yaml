  My professional goal, at this time, is to become a better architect so that
  I may create better solutions that cost less, are ready in less time, and
  are more resilient to the ravages of time. Personally, I wish to focus on
  solving problems that impact peopleâ€™s everyday lives; over time, I aim to
  address problems of ever greater magnitude and importance, to improve my
  community, my country, and the world.
