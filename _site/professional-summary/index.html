      <p>Over the past four years, I have been focused on applying this process to
create SMEIR, an information warfare training environment for the US
special forces, that leverages a wide variety of commercial, open-source,
and purpose-built software and hardware to replicate social media, news,
commerce, utilities, and other major industries, enabling operators to
“train as they fight.” SMEIR began as a proof of concept with a few LAMP
stack websites replicating the functionality and appearance of Twitter,
Facebook, and YouTube, running on a single box. When users wanted to test
offensive cyber operations against one website without disrupting another,
I split the applications across several VMs and began migrating to Docker
containers to simplify deployments; when exercise planners needed a means
of easily manipulating the cyber range, I created a central command and
control tool capable of managing the websites. Over time, more products
were added: Wikipedia, SnapChat, Gmail, IRC, and Tor, to name a few. As
new feedback and new requests came in, I reviewed what they meant for the
product and whether they fit into the vision or whether the vision needed
to be refined. At each stage I also evaluated whether the architecture 
and infrastructure supported the current vision, which led me to the 
realization that SMEIR had outgrown Docker Swarm and led me to migrate to
Kubernetes to take advantage of it’s more mature automation and scaling 
capabilities. Throughout my four years of leadership, SMEIR grew from that
single server running a LAMP stack to a highly scalable and rapidly
replicable Kubernetes cluster consisting of over 100 distinct components,
and I grew the team to more than 15 developers, testers, DevOps, and
sysadmins.</p>

      <p>I am currently looking for opportunities that stretch my current 
capabilities, introduce me to new and emerging technologies, and expose
me to the ideas of other architects and designers, having more or
different experience. My ideal position would offer a mixture of
architecture, design, proof of concept work, team leadership, and
mentoring less experienced developers, for a small or mid-sized company,
working with modern, cloud-native technologies.</p>

      <p>My professional goal, at this time, is to become a better architect so that
I may create better solutions that cost less, are ready in less time, and
are more resilient to the ravages of time. Personally, I wish to focus on
solving problems that impact people’s everyday lives; over time, I aim to
address problems of ever greater magnitude and importance, to improve my
community, my country, and the world.</p>
